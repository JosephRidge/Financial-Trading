    "## Financial trading:\n",
    "--> **Buying and selling** of financial assets, also called **financial securities**.\n",
    "- People trade a variety of financial instruments, including equities: shares of stocks representing ownership of companies, bonds: debt instruments issued by the government or corporations, forex or foreign exchange market of currencies, commodities such as gold, silver, and oil, and cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A trader makes a profit:\n",
    "- When **buying** a security at a lower price and selling later at a higher price, known as **going long**. \n",
    "- Conversely, they may **sell** a (borrowed) security at a **higher price** and **buy it back at a lower price**, known as **going short**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Institutional traders: \n",
    "- Such as **hedge funds** or **investment banks**, may trade in order to hedge financial risks, provide market liquidity, or re-balance their portfolios. \n",
    "- **Retail traders** are mostly trading for their own accounts, sometimes as a side hustle.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Trading vs investing\n",
    "- The main difference between trading and investing is time-horizon. **Trading** typically has a **shorter holding period**, ranging from days to months. **Investing** has a **longer time horizon**, ranging up to years or even decades. \n",
    "- **Trading** focuses on **short-term market trends** and tries to **profit from volatility** and **price fluctuations**.\n",
    "- **Investing** focuses on **market fundamentals, macroeconomic environment**, and aims to ride on **big trends** that can span years. \n",

    "- The resulting **line chart** gives us information on **past price pattern**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Candlestick chart \n",
    "We can also **visualize** the price movement using a candlestick chart. Each candlestick shows price information for one-period, for example one-day. Within each candle we can see: open and close in the candle body and high and low in the candlewick. Typically a white or green candle represents the close price above the open price, and a black or red candle represents the close price below the open price.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Plotting CandleStick Chart\n",
    "- We can easily plot candlestick charts with the Python package **\"plotly dot graph underscore objects\"**.\n",
    "- We import the package as **go** and then **define** a **candlestick using the time series data index**, ie Date, and the \"Open\", \"High\", \"Low\", \"Close\" columns in the price data. We then call Figure to create a plot, passing in our data as a list. Finally, we call the \"show\" method to display it. This will create an interactive chart."

    "## Financial Trading with bt \n",
    "- **Bt** provides a flexible framework for defining and backtesting trading **strategies** in Python. \n",

    "- A **trading strategy** is a *method* of *buying and selling financial assets* based on predefined rules. \n",
    "\n",
    "- For technical trading, rules are usually based on technical indicators and signals. **Backtesting** is a way to assess the effectiveness of a strategy by testing it on historical data. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The test result is evaluated to determine how it would have performed if used in the past, and whether it will be viable for further trading. To import the bt package, use import bt.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The bt Process ( exists in 4 steps). \n",
    "-  Step 1: We obtain historical price data of the assets we are going to trade.\n",
    "- Step 2: Define the strategy. \n",
    "- Step 3: Backtest the strategy with the historical data\n",
    "- Step 4: Evaluate the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Get the Data\n",
    "- load the data \n",
    "First, we need some price data. One way is to load data contained in a CSV file. With bt, we can also use its get function to fetch data online directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "- By default, it downloads the \"Adjusted Close\" prices from Yahoo Finance by tickers. A **ticker** is an abbreviated identifier for a **public-traded stock**, and the **\"Adjusted Close\"** price is adjusted for events like corporate actions such as stock splits, dividends, etc. \n",
    "- Prices of **multiple securities** can be downloaded at once by specifying **multiple tickers** within a single string separated by commas. \n",
    "- Use **\"start\"** and **\"end\"** to specify the start date and end date.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Define the Strategy \n",
    "Next we define our strategy with **bt.Strategy**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The **\"Strategy\"** contains trading logics by combining various **\"algos\"**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This unique feature of bt allows us to easily create strategies by mixing and matching different algos, each of which acts like a small task force that performs a specific operation. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Within \"Strategy\" we first assign a name.\n",
    "- Then we define a list of algos in the square brackets. The first \"algo\" specifies when to execute trades. Here we specify a simple rule to execute trades every week using \"RunWeekly\".\n",
    "- We will learn how to add more complex trading logic in later chapters. \n",
    "- The second \"algo\" specifies what data the strategy will apply to, for simplicity we apply to all the data using \"SelectAll\". The third \"algo\" specifies, in the case of multiple assets, what weights apply to each asset. Here \"WeighEqually\" means, for example, if we have two stocks, we will always allocate equal amounts of capital to each stock. \n",
    "- The last \"algo\" specifies that it will re-balance the asset weights according to what we have specified in the previous step. We now have a strategy that will execute trades weekly on a portfolio that holds several stocks. It will sell a stock that has risen in price and redistribute the profit to buy a stock that has fallen in price, maintaining an equal amount of holdings in each stock.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Backtest \n",
    "Now we can perform backtesting. Use \"**bt.Backtest**\" to combine the data and previously defined strategy, and create a \"backtest\". Call \"**bt.run**\" to run the backtest and save the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Evaluate the result \n",
    "We can use \"**.plot**\" to plot and review the result. \n",
    "- The line chart shows if we apply the strategy to trade Google, Amazon, Tesla stocks weekly, buy and sell them to maintain an equal weighted stock portfolio, in the six months during 2020 our portfolio will increase from 100 to 180. Not bad! We can also use \"get underscore transactions\" to print out the transaction details. We will explore more detailed performance statistics later in the course."

    "\n",
    "## Type of Indicators\n",
    "There are mainly three types of indicators.\n",
    "- **Trend indicators**, such as Moving Average, Average Directional Movement Index, measure the direction or strength of a trend. \n",
    "- **Momentum indicators**, such as Relative Strength Index, measure the velocity of price movement, that is the rate of change in an upward or downward direction. \n",

    "\n",
    "## Moving average indicators \n",
    "- Simple Moving average (SMA) and Exponential Moving Average (EMA). They are called \"moving\" averages because every average value is calculated using data points of the most recent n periods, and hence moves along with the price. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Calculating the averages creates a smoothing effect which helps to give a clearer indication of which direction the price is moving either upward, downward, or sideways. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Moving averages calculated based on a longer lookback period have more smoothing effects than a shorter one.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Simple Moving Average (SMA) \n",
    "An SMA is the **arithmetic mean** of the past **n** prices.\n",
    "- N is a chosen number of periods for calculating the mean. Earlier, we calculated SMA with **the dot rolling dot mean** method of a **DataFrame**. With **talib**, we can simply call **talib.SMA** and pass the DataFrame column, in this case the Close price. - Use the timeperiod parameter to specify the averaging period. **Note:**  since an n-period SMA needs at least n data points to calculate the first average value, we will get NA values for the first n minus 1 rows. Instead, we can use the tail method to check the last 5 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Plotting the SMA \n",
    "- We can plot SMAs together with the price with matplotlib.\n",
    "- The label is added to indicate each data series. \n",
    "- The blue line is the SMA calculated with a shorter lookback period, and it traces the price movement closely. \n",
    "- The red line is the SMA calculated with a longer lookback period, and is smoother and less responsive to the price fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Exponential Moving Average (EMA) \n",
    "- Another popular type of moving average is the exponential moving average, or EMA.\n",
    "- An **EMA** is an **exponentially weighted average** of the last n prices, where the weight decreases exponentially with each previous price. \n",
    "- To implement an **EMA** with **talib**, call talib dot EMA and pass the DataFrame column as input, in this case the Close price. Similarly, specify the averaging period with the timeperiod parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting the EMA \n",
    "As with **SMAs**, we see when plotting EMAs and the price data, the shorter EMA in blue is more reactive to the price movement compared to the longer **EMA** in **red**.\n",
    "\n",
    "## SMA vs. EMA \n",
    "- The main difference between **SMAs** and **EMAs** is that EMAs give higher weight to the more recent data, while SMAs assign equal weight to all data points.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As shown in the plot containing EMA and SMA (calculated with the same lookback window), whenever the price makes a big change, the EMA in the orange line is more sensitive to the price move compared to the SMA in the blue line.\n",

    "> # Strength indicator: ADX\n",
    "In this lesson, we will learn about a popular trend strength indicator called Average Directional Movement Index or ADX.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is ADX? \n",
    "ADX stands for **\"Average Directional Movement Index\"**. \n",
    "- It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, who elaborated the concept in his famous book \"New Concepts in Technical Systems\".\n",
    "\n",
    "- Wilder created ADX with the intention to measure the strength of a trend objectively. ADX can indicate whether an asset price is trending or merely moving sideways. **However**, it does not tell the direction of a **trend**, that is **bullish (rising prices)** or **bearish (falling prices)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ADX oscillates between 0 and 100. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In general, an ADX less than 25 indicates the market is going sideways and has no clear trend. An ADX above 25 indicates the market is trending, and an ADX above 50 suggests a strong trending market.\n",
    "\n",
    "## How is ADX calculated? \n",
    "ADX is obtained using lengthy and complicated calculations. Simply put, ADX is derived from two other indicators:\n",
    "- **plus DI and minus DI**. The plus DI, or plus directional index, **quantifies** the **presence of an uptrend**;\n",
    "- **minus DI**, or **minus directional index**, quantifies the presence of a **downtrend**.\n",
    "- **ADX** is the **smoothed averages** of the difference between **plus DI and minus DI**. \n",
    "- The calculation input for ADX includes the high, low and close prices of each period.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Implementing ADX in Python \n",
    "ADX can be implemented in Python by calling **talib.ADX**, and passing three types of price data as input, the high, low and close price. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Originally Welles Wilder used a 14-period lookback window for ADX calculations, which became the industry standard. You can change the default period with the timeperiod parameter. Keep in mind, the longer the lookback window, the less sensitive the ADX is to the price fluctuations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In other words, a **14-day ADX** is more **sensitive** to **daily price changes** **than a 21-day ADX**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Sometimes traders change the lookback period to suit their trading time horizons. For example, a position trader who holds a trading position for several months would likely use a longer lookback period. In this sample code, we calculate ADX and save it in a new DataFrame column. We can use dot tail to check the last 5 rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Plotting ADX \n",
    "\n",
    "- Usually, an ADX plot is placed horizontally under a price plot, so we can observe the price and indicator changes together along the same timeline. This can be accomplished by using the matplotlib subplots function. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this sample code, we create a set of subplots, ax1 and ax2, to plot the price and ADX separately. We can also use set underscore ylabel to label the y axis of each subplot for more clarity. Notice in the chart, the ADX starts to rise when the price is steadily trending up.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The ADX starts to decline when the uptrend in price is stalling and price is moving sideways.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> # Momentum indicator: RSI \n",
    "## What is RSI? \n",
    "RSI stands for Relative Strength Index. \n",
    "\n",
    "It was also developed by Welles Wilder.\n",
    "\n",
    "- RSI has been the most popular indicator used to measure momentum, which is the speed of rising or falling in prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The RSI oscillates between 0 and 100. Traditionally an RSI over 70 indicates an overbought market condition, which means the asset is overvalued and the price may reverse. \n",
    "\n",
    "- An RSI below 30 suggests an oversold market condition, which means the asset is undervalued and the price may rally.\n",
    "\n",
    "##  How is RSI calculated? \n",
    "The RSI calculation follows a straightforward formula. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **RS, or Relative Strength**, is the **average** of the upward price changes over a chosen n periods, divided by the average of downward price changes over those n periods.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The **formula** is constructed in such a way that an **RSI is bounded between 0 and 100.**\n",
    "\n",
    "##  Implementing RSI in Python \n",
    "RSI can be implemented in Python by calling **talib.RSI** and passing the price column. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Similar to the ADX, Welles Wilder used a 14-period lookback window for RSI calculations, which became the industry standard. \n",
    "\n",
    "- You can change the default period with the timeperiod parameter. Note the longer the lookback window, the less sensitive the RSI is to the price fluctuations. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Traders may want to change the default time period to suit their specific trading time horizons, or as a variable input for testing different trading strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this sample code, we calculated the **RSI** and saved it in a new DataFrame column. \n",
    "\n",
    "- We can use **.tail()** to check the last 5 rows.\n",

    "## Plotting RSI \n",
    "Similar to the ADX, it is helpful to plot the **price and the RSI one above another**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In this sample code, we created two subplots, the top plot shows the price, and the bottom plot shows the RSI. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Notice in the chart, when the RSI is falling near 30, the price bottoms out and gradually recovers, and when the RSI value is approaching 70, the price reaches new highs and is more likely to pull back.\n",

    "## Bollinger Bands implications\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the upper and lower bands are calculated based on standard deviations from the mean price, they adjust to volatility swings in the underlying price. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The wider the Bollinger Bands, the more volatile the asset prices.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  In addition, Bollinger Bands intend to answer the **question: is the price too high or too low on a relative basis?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statistically speaking, if the upper and lower bands are based on **1 standard deviation**, they contain about 68% of the recent price moves.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Similarly, if the bands are based on **2 standard deviations**, they contain about 95% of recent price moves. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In other words, the price only moves out of the upper or lower bands in 5% of the cases. Hence, we can say the price is relatively expensive when it is close to the upper band, and relatively cheap when it is close to the lower band.\n",

    "## Implementing Bollinger Bands in Python \n",
    "\n",
    "Bollinger Bands can be implemented in Python by calling **talib.BBANDS** and passing the DataFrame column, in this case, the **Close price**.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify the lookback period with the timeperiod parameter, which is 20 by default. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, use **nbdevup** and **nbdevdn** to specify the number of **standard deviations** away from the middle band for the upper and lower band respectively, **which is 2 by default**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- It produces** three output Series**, which are respectively;\n",
    "-  the upper band\n",
    "-  the middle moving average line\n",
    "-  the lower band. They can be saved in separate variables\n",

    "## Plotting Bollinger Bands\n",
    "- **Bollinger Bands** are commonly plotted on top of the price as this code demonstrates.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we can see, the **Bollinger Bands** become **wider** when the **price has big upward** or **downward swings**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- When the green price data gets closer to the red upper or red lower band, it tends to reverse temporarily before continuing the original upward or downward movement."
